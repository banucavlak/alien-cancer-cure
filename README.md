# Alien Cancer Cures

A number of cancer patients from a hospital in California claimed that they had been abducted by some friendly aliens for two months, after they suddenly appeared at the University Hospital Zürich. It was proposed that they had been administered a gut microbiota-modifying treatment by the aliens. Having received the fecal microbiome sequence data and the metadata from 26 alleged alien abductees and 135 non-abducted cancer patients, this project aims to investigate the mysterious “Alien Cancer Cures”. By examining the fecal microbiome characteristics and linking them with different patient characteristics, we should be able to identify predictive biomarkers for alien abduction and treatment, and potentially determine whether these health interventions are beneficial for the patients.

## Code Structure
- Under data directory, we have the output files produced by our analysis.
- Under plots directory, we have the plots we generate to summarize our findings.
- Under src-analysis directory, we have the code that analyzes the microbiome sequences of patients.
- Under src-plots directory, we have the code that generates our plots.
- Under utils directory, we have the code for some helper functions.
